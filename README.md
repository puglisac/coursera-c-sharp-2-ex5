# Exercise 5: While Loops

This is an exercise for the coursera course [More C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/more-programming-unity)

### Problem 1 - Create and use a menu using a while loop

Start up your IDE and create a new Console Application project named Exercise5. Save the project in a reasonable location on the computer.

Create a menu of choices for your user. It should look like the following:

```
Menu:
1−NewGame
2−LoadGame
3−Options
4−Quit
```

You should then prompt for and read in the user’s choice as an integer.

Your application should print an appropriate response confirming their choice, such as:

`Loading  game...`

If the user selects 4, you should stop the while loop and exit the application when the user presses enter.

### Problem 2 - Implement input validation

Add a while loop that validates the user's input value before printing the appropriate message or quits the game. Although you could include this validation in your if statement and your outer while loop, use a while loop for this to get more practice with while loops.

### Problem 3 - Refactor

Now that you've practiced using another while loop, delete the while loop from the previous problem and use your if statement and the outer while loop to implement the input validation.
